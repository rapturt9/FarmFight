Hi Team, this is a Document to lay out the basic ideas for game design and suggest changes.
** Basic Gameplay: **
*The Board:*
5 hexagons on each side, and line on top (instead of point on top). It will take up the majority of the screen. Water will surround the land.
*The Crops:*
|            | Potato | Carrot | Wheat | Golden Rice |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| Price      | 1$     | 2$     | 2$    | 10$         |
| Harvest    | 1      | 4      | 2     | 10          |
| Resistance | 0      | 2      | 6     | 10          |
Price is cost of crop. Harvest stat determines how much money you get when harvesting the crop (some math formula). Resistance stat determines how well the crop will grow in territory that is damaged by soldies (some math formula).
*Farmers:*
Typically, to harvest a crop, you try to click it at the exact time it is ripe. However, this is difficult with a large amount of crops, so farmers will do it for you and they cost 1$ each. However, if a soldier attacks that tile, the farmer will disappear.

*The Soldiers:*

To deploy them to a tile, you click the tile, and the soldier travels along the lines until they reach there. Additionally, soldiers from the defending person deal 1.5x more damage since home base advantage. 
Soldiers look like farmers with pitchforks. To deploy them to a tile, you click the tile, and the soldier travels along the lines until they reach there. Additionally, soldiers from the defending person deal 1.5x more damage since home base advantage. 

They will cost 5$ each and can be redeployed after battle on territory finishes.

*The Battles:*

Soldiers each have their own health and deal splash damage to all other soldiers on same tile. Battle visualization will look like a pie chart and a cloud behind it. The size of the pieces on the pie chart is determined by health and number of soldiers on each side.

To take control of another tile, your soldiers must be the only ones from a team on the tile for 3 seconds.

*The Endgame:*

Two modes (decide between them or include both in game): 
*Domination* - goal is to control the whole board and player who does that wins
Dogfight - player who takes control of center tile wins
