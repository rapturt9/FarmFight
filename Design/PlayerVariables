Here are the player variables we should need:
- List of tiles owned by player with crops information are embedded tile information 
  - We can make sure that players can only plant crops in adjacent tile
  - What crop is on tile
  - Players can harvest crops they own, crop growth stages stored in tile
  - Farmer information stored on tiles (boolean value whether they are there)
  - Late game: what soldiers are on tiles/tile health
- Money (int) stores total money of player
- Soldier information and what tile they are going to
